Given the analysis performed, one important insight that was identified involved the main campaign goal being €4,000, which is outside the range of outliers for the amount pledged specifically for the Great Britain's market, so Louise should probably try to get her produced for less than €4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than €2,000, which is as well just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
